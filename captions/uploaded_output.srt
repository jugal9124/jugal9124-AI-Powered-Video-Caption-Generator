00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm going to show you how we can mod our DSi XL and play all of our favorite games off

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
of the SD card.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,200
The first thing we're going to need to do is open up the camera app.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,600
We need to go in the album and see if this John has the Facebook.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,600
I am human.

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,160
Mine does, so the next thing we need to do is power down our system and remove the SD card.

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,200
Over on our computer, we need to download the DSi, AIO, zip file and extract it.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,240
Insert your SD card into your computer, select everything except for the memory pit folder

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,320
and copy it to the root of your SD card.

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,960
Now we need to go all the way deep in the private folder on your SD card till we get to the

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,200
pit.bin file.

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,000
Rename this file and then we need to go back into the memory pit folder.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,200
Now drag the new pit.bin file into the private folder.

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,200
Put your SD card back in your DSi and reopen the camera app.

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,480
With SD card selected, tap the album icon.

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,560
This is going to boot you into the Twilight menu setup.

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,320
Just choose your language and your region.

18
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,000
Now that we have Twilight menu installed, we need to add our games.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,360
Back on our computer, we need to create a ROMs folder to drop all of our games in.

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,080
And just like that, all of our favorite games are here ready to play from the launcher.

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,920
In my opinion, there's no better way to play DS games than on a DSi XL.
